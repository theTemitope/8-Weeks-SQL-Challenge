## Problem Statement
Danny's Diner needs help to stay afloat. He needs to deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program. 
Additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

## Objectives
- Help Danny understand the different type of customers he has, their preferences, their visiting patterns and how much money they spend on each meal
- Help Danny determine if the feedback from the first report clearly alligns with the existing customer loyalty program
